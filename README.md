# regression_based_machine_learning_to_predict_wind_power_generation

This project is coded by me in collaboration with Shengqi Wu. It is a model to perform regression based machine learning (both active learning and random-selection) on the data set https://www.kaggle.com/berkerisen/wind-turbine-scada-dataset.

The project can self-adjust the parameters to achieve the best precision (determined by the mean of absolute value of residual errors). Multithreading is used for faster training.
